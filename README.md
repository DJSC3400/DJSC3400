- 👋  Hi, I’m @DJSC3400
- 👀  I’m interested in  board games, and to a lesser extend videogames, music, synthisizers, DAW, and buzzy computer science things, like AI and large language modles. I am also really intrested in math and creating open source numeric methods.
-     I play lots of different instruments. I am also really intrested in policy and international poiltics, and how humankind can effectivley pool resources to overcome common ails. I like using emoticons and symbol artwork instead of emojis and art.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Java and studying computer science. I have done some electrical engineering as well. I am also always trying to learn new music and instruments. 
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on games, music, synthisizers, DAW, and buzzy computer science things, like AI and large language modles.
